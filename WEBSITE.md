use react js (vite?)
local site for now then look into deploying data in google cloud backend
free hosting frontend?

requirements::
select filepath feature (not now)
choose random file feature
compute similar (script which will call the built main program -- select 50 random, the base to compare against, and returns the filepaths of 5 similar) 
javascript -> vector of all similar selections in array with left and right button to decrement and increment counter to display each object in array (reloads page dynamically)
